## About Index.html file

Starting from the V0.2-Alpha version, we offer two versions of index.html

One is index-cloud.html, this release uses the CSS and JS file addresses provided by the author, and there is index.html to run the resource file within the directory of the site, please download the V0.2-alpha release for the Details static.zip file

## Other

jump.html uses the jump mode for delay , you can modify extended time at will.

Starting from the v0.3-alpha version, we have added an optional background animation option, which depends on [Particles.js](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js) animation. Both the cloud version and the local version refer to jsDelivr resources.

**[Particles.js](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js) is developed by Vincentgarreau, respecting the author copyright**
